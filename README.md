## ‚¨áÔ∏è Download

Download the linux and macOS scripts from the [releases page](https://github.com/anonfaded/wifade/releases/tag/v1.0).


## Features

- Automated password testing on multiple SSIDs.
- Simple configuration of target SSIDs and passwords.
- (Future versions may include password dictionary support.)

## How It Works

The script systematically attempts to connect to Wi-Fi networks using a list of passwords. For Linux, it employs the escape key to dismiss any authentication dialogs, ensuring uninterrupted operation.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- A Linux or macOS system with bash support.
- Necessary network permissions for ethical testing.



### Usage

#### Installation

### Prerequisites

Before using Wifade, ensure you have the necessary package installed to enable the escape key functionality for dismissing authentication dialogs on Linux:

    Install xdotool for simulating key presses:

```bash
    sudo apt-get install xdotool
```

After installing xdotool, follow the installation instructions below for Wifade to set up the script on your system.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/anonfaded/wifade.git
```

Navigate to the WiFade directory:

```
cd wifade
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x linux-script.sh
```

Run the script from your terminal:

1. For linux version of script:
```bash
./linux-script.sh
```
2. For macOS version of script:
```bash
./macOS-script.sh
```

### Configuration

Edit the script to specify your target Wi-Fi networks and passwords:

1. SSIDs: Locate the SSIDS array and add the SSIDs(WiFi names) of the networks you wish to test.

```bash
SSIDS=("YourSSID1" "YourSSID2" "YourSSID3")
```

2. Passwords: In the PASSWORDS array, list all the passwords you want to attempt.

```bash
PASSWORDS=("password1" "password2" "password3")
```

Please ensure you only edit these sections to avoid unexpected script behavior.

## Script Execution

Once initiated, the script begins its operation. Simply observe the terminal output; if the correct password is discovered, it will be highlighted in color alongside a success message.
